## üå±About
Transcendence covers most things in full-stack webapplication. <br>
**The application is simple.**  <br>
User creates and acount, unless already created then just needs to loggin. <br>
The user can see there *stats* and a *leaderboard* displaying the top 3 players for each game. <br>
The user can choose for both games if he/she wants to play a tournemnet or with a freind. <br>
The user can aswell find their and from other users the history matchtes. <br>
user has a settings side, where Avatar, username, alias name, password can be changed. <br>
The user can view their given data, has the option to delete their account. <br>

The subject wants you to choose **7 Major modlues** *(two Minor modlues equal one Major module)*
<details>
  <summary><strong>We choose:</strong></summary>
  <br>

## ‚ô£Ô∏èWe choose:

- **Major** : Use a framework to build the backend 	<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; - Required framework **->** **Typscript** <br>
					
- **Major** : Implementing Advanced 3D Techniques <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Reqiured tool is **babylon**	<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- We implemented a fully 3D version of the classic Pong game <br>

- **Major** : Standard user management, authentication, users across tournaments. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Registration with username, alias, password, and avatar. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Secure login. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Multiplayer support across tournaments. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Match history available to all users. <br>

- **Major** : Add another game with user history and matchmaking <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Added Snake *(Snek)*, has a match history with scores, wins, and losses. <br>

- **Minor** : Use a framework or toolkit to build the front-end <br>	
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Tools: **HTML + Tailwind CSS**	<br>

- **Minor** : Use a database for the backend <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- We used **SQLite** <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- If you have a backend, it makes sence to use a database, <br> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;because you can store user data, match history, scores, and more. <br>

- **Minor** : Expanding browser compatibility <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and other major browsers. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- *Easy module, becuase that happends automtally*	<br>

- **Minor** : Supports multiple languages <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- User can switch for different languages <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Could probably use a toolkit, but we used the **data-i18n** attribute for simple <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;multilingual support. <br>

- **Minor** : User and game stats dashboards <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- ***Dashboards shows:*** <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&emsp;- Highest scores <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&emsp;- Wins and losses <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&emsp;- Leaderboards for top 3 players <br>

- **Minor** : GDPR compliance options with user anonymization, <br> local data management, and account deletion.	<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- User can delete account/ their data. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- User can edit their data *(username, alias, password, avatar)* <br>	
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- User can view their data. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- **GDRP** *(General Data Protection Regulation)* : <br> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;We have a privicy policy, so the user knows what will happend with their data <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp; *(Ensures transparency and control over personal information)*

<br> <br>

## üå±Docker

### ‚ô£Ô∏èDocker Compose Files
We used two different docker compose files.
- `docker-compose-dev.yml` **->** used during **development**.
- `docker-compose.yml` **->** Used for **production**.

***Why two files?*** <br>
The docker-compose-dev.yml file was created to streamline the development process. <br>
It allows live updates without needing to rebuild the entire Docker image after every change. <br>

*For example:*
- When editing HTML or frontend code, changes are reflected immediately.
- This drastically reduces development time by skipping unnecessary recompilation steps.

The docker-compose.yml file is optimized for production and includes the final setup with all necessary build steps and configurations.

***How to get a development and productio environment?*** <br>
In the docker-compose look for the backend environment:
- Development Option:
```
environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
```
- Production Option:
```
environment:
    - NODE_ENV=production
```

In the docker-compose look for **command** for both backend & frontend:

- Development Option:
```
command: [ "pnpm", "run", "dev" ]
```
- Production Option:
```
command: [ "pnpm", "run", "prod" ]
```

### ‚ô£Ô∏èContainers
- **Frontend Container** <br>
  Serves the user interface built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
- **Backend Container** <br>
   Runs the TypeScript-based backend server that handles authentication, <br>
   matchmaking, and game logic.

### ‚ô£Ô∏èVolumes
We use two Docker volumes:
- **Database Volume**
  - Persists the SQLite database file.
  - Ensures that data is not lost between container restarts.
- **Cookie Volume**
  - Stores session and authentication cookies.
  - Keeps user login data across sessions.
<br>


## üå±Swagger (Backend)
We used **Swagger UI** *(localhost:3000/docs)* <br>
It‚Äôs useful for both backend and frontend teams <br>

### What is Swagger?
Swagger UI is an open-source tool that reads an API‚Äôs OpenAPI **(Swagger)** specification and turns it into a clean, interactive web page. <br> 

***It displays:*** <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; ‚Ä¢ All available endpoints <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; ‚Ä¢ The parameters they require <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; ‚Ä¢ The possible responses

### Why it's useful
- **Frontend** can see which routes to call, what parameters to send, and what responses to expect. <br>
- **Backend** can test endpoints directly in the browser without writing extra code. <br>

<br>


## üå±Drizzle (Backend)

### What is Drizzle?
Drizzle is a type-safe Object-Relational Mapping **(ORM)** tool for TypeScript and JavaScript. <br>

**In other words:** <br>
You can write database queries in TypeScript with full type safety‚Äîyour database schema and queries are strongly typed, so mistakes are caught during development instead of breaking your app at runtime.
<br>

### What Drizzle Lets You Do
1) ***Viewing the database*** <br>
- Use Drizzle Studio *(the included web UI)* to explore tables, columns, and data.
- Run queries, view schemas, and inspect results directly in the browser.

2) ***Change Column Types Safely***
- Define your schema in TypeScript.
- If a column‚Äôs type changes *(age from a number to text)*, update your schema file.
- Run a migration *(generated by Drizzle)* to update the database.
- The database will try to convert existing values automatically *(25 ‚Üí "25")*.
- If conversion isn‚Äôt possible *("hello" ‚Üí number)*, the migration will fail unless you add explicit casting.


### How to Use Drizzle Studio
1. Install drizzle-kit
2. Open Studio <br>
Run `npx drizzle-kit studio` <br> This will give you your web UI ‚Üí *you copy-paste the web UI into your browser*
3. Use the web UI to view and inspect your database
<br>

## üå±data-i18n (Language)

We decided we gonna use data-i18n. <br>
data-i18n is just one common convention for handling translations, ***but*** *it‚Äôs not the only option*. <br> Depending on your needs, you can either roll your own approach or use well-established i18n libraries/toolkits that handle translations, pluralization, formatting, and even right-to-left languages. <br> 

### ‚ô£Ô∏èWhat is data-i18n?
data-i18n is not a built-in HTML attribute, but a custom data attribute.
It‚Äôs part of the HTML5 **data-*** **attribute system**, which allows you to store extra information *(custom data)* on HTML elements.

In the case of data-i18n, developers use it to mark elements that should be translated.

### ‚ô£Ô∏èWhy use data-i18n?
Instead of hardcoding text into your HTML like this:
```html
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This is the intro.</p>
```
You write:
```html
<h1 data-i18n="welcome_message"></h1>
<p data-i18n="intro_text"></p>
```
This makes your page language-agnostic. The actual words will be filled in by JavaScript/TypeScript at runtime, depending on the selected language.

### ‚ô£Ô∏èAlternatives to data-i18n

#### üåç 1. Inline text replacement markers <br>
You can insert placeholders directly in your HTML. <br>
A templating engine then replaces those placeholders with the correct translations at runtime.

<br> 

```html
<h1>{{welcome_message}}</h1>
```


`{{welcome_message}}` is a placeholder *(a translation key).*

A templating engine *(like Handlebars, Mustache, Vue, or React)* looks up the key in your translation files. <br>
The engine automatically swaps the placeholder with the correct text for the active language. <br> <br>

#### üåç 2. Popular Toolkits for Internationalization

General JavaScript / Web | Short explanation
--- | ---
i18next | Full-featured i18n library, works in plain JS and all major frameworks. 
FormatJS / React Intl |  Powerful message formatting, best for React apps. 
Polyglot.js |  Lightweight library, good for small projects. 

Framework-Specific | Short explanation
--- | ---
React Intl / Next.js i18n | Built for React/Next.js, integrates with components and routing.
Vue I18n | Official Vue plugin for translations.
Angular i18n | Built-in Angular support for template translations.

Server-Side *(Backend)* | Short explanation
--- | ---
Django i18n *(Python)* | Built-in translation system using .po files.
Rails i18n *(Ruby)* | Built-in YAML-based translations.
Spring i18n *(Java)* | Uses messages.properties for localization.

<br>

### ‚ô£Ô∏èHow it works
The attribute itself does nothing by default‚Äîit‚Äôs just metadata.
What makes it work is JavaScript *(or a translation library)* that reads the data-i18n attributes, looks up the corresponding translations, and replaces the element‚Äôs text.

#### üåç 1. Create a json file:
NOTE the json file will have a key and a value.
The key is called in the HTML the value is the translted text.

## üå±Backend Call
-  Connection between frontend and backend
- frontend
The supject requireds you to use a single web application, wich means only one html page is being used. 
We always reloaded the body of the html with the new content we needed.

Things that might be usefull:
call to the backend
took us a while to understand how we call the backend, but is pretty simple.
the string that you get from your html input needs to stringefid. 
export function inputToContent(input: string[]): string {
	const obj: Record<string, string> = {};

	input.forEach(id => {
		const elem = document.getElementById(id) as HTMLInputElement | null;
		if (elem)
		{
			const rawInput = elem.value;
			const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(rawInput); // Removes unsafe HTML
			obj[elem.id] = sanitizedInput;
		}
	});

	const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(obj);
	return jsonStr;
}

const content = inputToContent(["username", "password"]);
			const body = requestBody("POST", content, "application/json");

			try {
				const response = await connectFunc("/user/login", body);
      export async function connectFunc(url: string, request: RequestInit): Promise<Response> {
	
	// console.log("Connect To " + url + " Using:")
	// console.log(request)

	const response = await httpGet("https://localhost:3000" + url, request);
	if (response.status === 402) {
		window.history.pushState({}, '', '/logIn');
		setupLogIn(); // Redirect to logIn
	}
	return response
}
