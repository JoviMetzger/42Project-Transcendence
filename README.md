# üß© Transcendence üèìüêç

Transcendence is a full-stack web application where users can <br>
create an account and play **3D Pong** or **2D Snake** games. <br>
This project was developed in collaboration with üìå[Julius](https://github.com/Codam-jde-baai) and üìå[Acco](https://github.com/Solypsist) .<br>

## üå±About
Transcendence covers most things in full-stack webapplication. <br>
**The application is simple.**  <br>
User creates and acount, unless already created then just needs to loggin. <br>
The user can see there *stats* and a *leaderboard* displaying the top 3 players for each game. <br>
The user can choose for both games if he/she wants to play a tournemnet or with a freind. <br>
The user can aswell find their and from other users the history matchtes. <br>
user has a settings side, where Avatar, username, alias name, password can be changed. <br>
The user can view their given data, has the option to delete their account. <br>

The subject wants you to choose **7 Major modlues** *(two Minor modlues equal one Major module)*
<details>
  <summary><strong>We choose:</strong></summary>
  <br>

## ‚ô£Ô∏èWe choose:

- **Major** : Use a framework to build the backend 	<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; - Required framework **->** **Typscript** <br>
					
- **Major** : Implementing Advanced 3D Techniques <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Reqiured tool is **babylon**	<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- We implemented a fully 3D version of the classic Pong game <br>

- **Major** : Standard user management, authentication, users across tournaments. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Registration with username, alias, password, and avatar. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Secure login. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Multiplayer support across tournaments. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Match history available to all users. <br>

- **Major** : Add another game with user history and matchmaking <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Added Snake *(Snek)*, has a match history with scores, wins, and losses. <br>

- **Minor** : Use a framework or toolkit to build the front-end <br>	
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Tools: **HTML + Tailwind CSS**	<br>

- **Minor** : Use a database for the backend <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- We used **SQLite** <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- If you have a backend, it makes sence to use a database, <br> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;because you can store user data, match history, scores, and more. <br>

- **Minor** : Expanding browser compatibility <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and other major browsers. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- *Easy module, becuase that happends automtally*	<br>

- **Minor** : Supports multiple languages <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- User can switch for different languages <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- Could probably use a toolkit, but we used the **data-i18n** attribute for simple <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;multilingual support. <br>

- **Minor** : User and game stats dashboards <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- ***Dashboards shows:*** <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&emsp;- Highest scores <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&emsp;- Wins and losses <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&emsp;- Leaderboards for top 3 players <br>

- **Minor** : GDPR compliance options with user anonymization, <br> local data management, and account deletion.	<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- User can delete account/ their data. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- User can edit their data *(username, alias, password, avatar)* <br>	
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- User can view their data. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;- **GDRP** *(General Data Protection Regulation)* : <br> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;We have a privicy policy, so the user knows what will happend with their data <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp; *(Ensures transparency and control over personal information)*

<br> <br>

## üå±Docker

### ‚ô£Ô∏èDocker Compose Files
We used two different docker compose files.
- `docker-compose-dev.yml` **->** used during **development**.
- `docker-compose.yml` **->** Used for **production**.

***Why two files?*** <br>
The docker-compose-dev.yml file was created to streamline the development process. <br>
It allows live updates without needing to rebuild the entire Docker image after every change. <br>

*For example:*
- When editing HTML or frontend code, changes are reflected immediately.
- This drastically reduces development time by skipping unnecessary recompilation steps.

The docker-compose.yml file is optimized for production and includes the final setup with all necessary build steps and configurations.

***How to get a development and productio environment?*** <br>
In the docker-compose look for the backend environment:
- Development Option:
```
environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
```
- Production Option:
```
environment:
    - NODE_ENV=production
```

In the docker-compose look for **command** for both backend & frontend:

- Development Option:
```
command: [ "pnpm", "run", "dev" ]
```
- Production Option:
```
command: [ "pnpm", "run", "prod" ]
```

### ‚ô£Ô∏èContainers
- **Frontend Container** <br>
  Serves the user interface built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
- **Backend Container** <br>
   Runs the TypeScript-based backend server that handles authentication, <br>
   matchmaking, and game logic.

### ‚ô£Ô∏èVolumes
We use two Docker volumes:
- **Database Volume**
  - Persists the SQLite database file.
  - Ensures that data is not lost between container restarts.
- **Cookie Volume**
  - Stores session and authentication cookies.
  - Keeps user login data across sessions.
<br>


## üå±Swagger (Backend)
We used **Swagger UI** *(localhost:3000/docs)* <br>
It‚Äôs useful for both backend and frontend teams <br>

### What is Swagger?
Swagger UI is an open-source tool that reads an API‚Äôs OpenAPI **(Swagger)** specification and turns it into a clean, interactive web page. <br> 

***It displays:*** <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; ‚Ä¢ All available endpoints <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; ‚Ä¢ The parameters they require <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp; ‚Ä¢ The possible responses

### Why it's useful
- **Frontend** can see which routes to call, what parameters to send, and what responses to expect. <br>
- **Backend** can test endpoints directly in the browser without writing extra code. <br>

<br>


## üå±Drizzle (Backend)

### What is Drizzle?
Drizzle is a type-safe Object-Relational Mapping **(ORM)** tool for TypeScript and JavaScript. <br>

**In other words:** <br>
You can write database queries in TypeScript with full type safety‚Äîyour database schema and queries are strongly typed, so mistakes are caught during development instead of breaking your app at runtime.
<br>

### What Drizzle Lets You Do
1) ***Viewing the database*** <br>
- Use Drizzle Studio *(the included web UI)* to explore tables, columns, and data.
- Run queries, view schemas, and inspect results directly in the browser.

2) ***Change Column Types Safely***
- Define your schema in TypeScript.
- If a column‚Äôs type changes *(age from a number to text)*, update your schema file.
- Run a migration *(generated by Drizzle)* to update the database.
- The database will try to convert existing values automatically *(25 ‚Üí "25")*.
- If conversion isn‚Äôt possible *("hello" ‚Üí number)*, the migration will fail unless you add explicit casting.


### How to Use Drizzle Studio
1. Install drizzle-kit
2. Open Studio <br>
Run `npx drizzle-kit studio` <br> This will give you your web UI ‚Üí *you copy-paste the web UI into your browser*
3. Use the web UI to view and inspect your database
<br>

## üå±HTTPS Certificate

**HTTPS** *(Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)* is a secure version of the HTTP protocol that uses the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt data sent between a web browser and a website.

In Transcendence, we used a **self-signed certificate** because our application runs on **Vite**, which is primarily a frontend development server rather than a full production web server like **Nginx** or **Apache**.

### ‚ô†Ô∏èTypes of SSL/TLS Certificates
Certificates differ in validation level *(how thoroughly the CA checks you)* and scope *(what domains they cover)*.

üîë **By Validation Level** ***(Trust Level)***

| Type                             | What It Validates                                              | How It‚Äôs Verified                                           | Trust Level                                                          | Typical Use                                 | Cost                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **DV (Domain Validation)**       | Only proves domain ownership                                   | Simple check (DNS record, file upload, or email link)       | üîí Basic encryption (padlock only)                                   | Blogs, personal sites, test projects        | Free (Let‚Äôs Encrypt) ‚Äì Low |
| **OV (Organization Validation)** | Domain + organization identity (business name, address, phone) | CA manually verifies company info in business registries    | üîí Higher trust (company details visible in cert info)               | Small‚Äìmedium businesses, corporate sites    | Medium                     |
| **EV (Extended Validation)**     | Domain + legal entity + strong proof of identity               | Rigorous CA checks (legal, physical, operational existence) | üîíüîí Highest trust (company legal name shown in certificate details) | Banks, e-commerce, fintech, big enterprises | High                       |

---

üåê **By Scope of Coverage** ***(What Domains They Secure)***
| Type                         | What It Covers                               | Example                                                               | Best For                         | Notes                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Single-Domain**            | Exactly one fully qualified domain name      | `example.com` (does **not** cover `www.example.com` unless specified) | Simple websites                  | Cheapest, but limited                    |
| **Wildcard**                 | One domain + **all subdomains** at one level | `*.example.com` ‚Üí covers `blog.example.com`, `shop.example.com`       | Sites with many subdomains       | Does **not** cover `sub.sub.example.com` |
| **Multi-Domain (SAN / UCC)** | Multiple unrelated domains under one cert    | `example.com`, `example.org`, `myshop.net`                            | Organizations running many sites | Flexible but can get complex             |



### ‚ô†Ô∏è How to get different Certificates

Therse certificates are for "real" world web applications/ full web server

<details>
  <summary><strong>üîê 1. Free & Automatic</strong> (Let‚Äôs Encrypt ‚Äî Recommended for Most Sites)</summary>
  <br>

### üîê 1. Free & Automatic (Let‚Äôs Encrypt ‚Äî Recommended for Most Sites)
- **What it is:** Let‚Äôs Encrypt is a free, automated Certificate Authority *(CA)*.
- **How it works:** 
    - **1.** Install a tool like `Certbot` on your web server.
    - **2.** Run a simple command `(certbot --nginx or certbot --apache)` and it will:
        - Generate a CSR *(certificate signing request)*.
        - Verify domain ownership automatically.
        - Install the certificate on your web server.
    - **3.** Certbot also sets up automatic renewal every 90 days.
- **Who it‚Äôs for:** Anyone running their own server *(VPS, cloud, etc.)* and wants free, hassle-free certificates.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üí≥ 2. Paid Certificates</strong> (From a Commercial CA)</summary>
<br>

### üí≥ 2. Paid Certificates (From a Commercial CA)
- **Where to buy:** 
DigiCert, Sectigo, GlobalSign, GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.
- **Steps:**
    - **1.** Generate a CSR on your server.
    - **2.** Submit it to the CA when purchasing.
    - **3.** The CA validates you *(DV/OV/EV level depending on what you bought)*.
    - **4.** Download and install the issued certificate on your server.
- **Pay if you need:**
    - `Wildcard` or `multi-domain` coverage.
    - `OV/EV` validation *(stronger business trust)*.
    - `Warranty/support` from the CA.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>üåê 3. Through Your Hosting Provider</strong></summary>
  <br>

### üåê 3. Through Your Hosting Provider
- Many hosting companies include SSL certificates for free *(often via Let‚Äôs Encrypt)*.
- Some sell premium ones if you need OV/EV.
- Usually, you just log into your hosting dashboard and click ‚ÄúEnable SSL‚Äù.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>üõ†Ô∏è 4. For Development / Internal Us</strong></summary>
  <br>

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. For Development / Internal Use
- You can generate a **self-signed certificate** *(using openssl or similar).*
- This will encrypt traffic but will not be trusted by browsers *(you‚Äôll get a warning)*.
- Useful for testing, intranet apps, or internal servers.

</details>

<br>
<br>
<br>

### ‚ô†Ô∏è How to Get Your Certificate for Transcendence
If you just want HTTPS locally, you don‚Äôt need a real CA *(like Let‚Äôs Encrypt)*. 

**Instead you can:**
- Use **self-signed certificates** *(trusted only on your machine)*.
- Or use a helper tool that creates dev-friendly SSL certs.

<br> <br>

**We used the self-signed certificates.** <br>
You have `Option A` and `Option B` <br>
*(I recommend **Option A**, We did **Option B**, which works but is not ideal and makes running the site on Firefox more complicated.)*

**Option A: Vite‚Äôs Built-in HTTPS Support (Recommended)** 

**1. Install [vite-plugin-mkcert](https://github.com/liuweiGL/vite-plugin-mkcert):**
```bash
npm install vite-plugin-mkcert -D
```
**2. Add it to `vite.config.js`:**
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import mkcert from 'vite-plugin-mkcert'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [mkcert()],
  server: {
    https: true
  }
})
```
**3. Run `vite`** ‚Üí It auto-generates trusted local certificates *(via mkcert)* so you can use `https://localhost:5173` without browser warnings.

<br>

**Option B: Shell Script with Self-Signed Certificate**

**1. Add an `entrypoint.sh`** <br>
Add a entrypoint.sh script in your frontend container to generate a self-signed certificate. <br>
**Don't forget to create a volume** `./frontend/certs:/app/certs`

<details>
  <summary><strong>üìù Example entrypoint.sh</strong></summary>
  <br>

### üìù Example entrypoint.sh

```shell
#!/bin/sh

echo "Starting entrypoint..."
set -e

CERT_PATH=/app/certs

mkdir -p $CERT_PATH
chmod 777 $CERT_PATH

# Create certs if they don't exist
if [ ! -f "$CERT_PATH/localhost.pem" ] || [ ! -s "$CERT_PATH/localhost.pem" ]; then
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
    -keyout "$CERT_PATH/localhost-key.pem" \
    -out "$CERT_PATH/localhost.pem" \
    -days 365 \
    -subj "/CN=localhost"
    
    echo "Certificate generated."
fi

# Set env vars so Vite uses HTTPS
export SSL_CRT_FILE=/app/certs/localhost.pem
export SSL_KEY_FILE=/app/certs/localhost-key.pem
export HTTPS=true

# Start app
pnpm dev
```

</details>
<br>

**2. A new `cert` directory will appear containing:**
- `localhost-key.pem`
- `localhost.pem`

<br>

**3. Add the certificates to your browser** <br>
Because our backend and frontend run on different ports, the frontend itself works fine, but the connection to the backend is blocked in Firefox.

**Why this happens:** <br>
**Chrome** ‚Üí Checks only the host *(localhost)*.As long as the host matches, frontend and backend can communicate, even if they‚Äôre on different ports. <br>
**Firefox** ‚Üí Checks both the host and the port.  Since the ports are different, Firefox treats the backend as a different origin and denies the connection. I guess this makes Firefox more secure, but also more annoying for local development.

**The fix for that:** <br>
**Chrome** ‚Üí you don't need to do anything. <br>
**Firefox** ‚Üí you need to add manually the certificate to your browser.<br>

#### Step 1: (Import the Certificate)
- **1.** Click the three horizontal lines *(hamburger menu ‚ò∞)* in the upper right corner.
- **2.** Click `Settings`.
- **3.** In the sidebar, go to `Privacy & Security`.
- **4.** Scroll down to the `Certificate` section.
- **5.** Click `View Certificate...`
- **6.** Switch to the `Authorities` tab ‚Üí Click `Import`.
- **7.** Select/find your `localhost.pem` file.
- **8.** Check: ‚úÖ"Trust this CA to identify websites"
- **9.** *(‚ö†Ô∏è* ***ONLY*** *if your backend and frontend port are different.)*
- **10**. Restart Firefox *(close and reopen Firefox)*

#### Step 2: Add a Server Exception *(Only if Backend Uses a Different Port)*
You only need to do this once unless your backend port changes.
- **1.** In the `Certificates` window, switch to the `Servers` tab
- **2.** Click `Add Exception...`
- **3.** Add your backend URL ‚Üí For us it is `https://localhost:3000`.
- **4.** Once you confirmed, the server will appear in the table.

## üå±dompurify (HTML)

### What is dompurify?
DOMPurify is a fast, client-side library for sanitizing HTML.
- It removes malicious or dangerous code *(like scripts, event handlers, or inline JavaScript)* from user-provided HTML.
- It ensures the HTML is safe to insert into the DOM, preventing vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting *(XSS)*.
- It works in browsers and even on server environments *(like Node.js)*.

### Why use dompurify?
When working with user input or dynamic HTML updates, we often need to insert content into the DOM. <br>
A common way to do this is via `element.innerHTML`. <br>

‚ö†Ô∏è However, innerHTML is not safe because:
- Attackers can inject `<script>` tags that execute malicious JavaScript.
- Inline event attributes *(onclick, onmouseover, etc.)* can execute harmful code.
- CSS tricks or malicious `<iframe>` tags can steal user data.

#### ü¶†Example <br>
**Input:** `<img src=x onerror=alert('Hacked!')>` <br>
**Output:** `<img src="x">` <br> <br>
The dangerous onerror attribute is removed, leaving only safe HTML. <br>
If you directly set this into the DOM with innerHTML, it will execute `alert('Hacked!')`.

DOMPurify solves this by stripping out unsafe attributes, tags, and scripts while keeping the safe HTML intact.

***Code Example***
```html
// User input fields (hardcoded for example)
const inputIds = ["username", "email", "password"];
const formData: Record<string, string> = {};

inputIds.forEach(id => {
  const elem = document.getElementById(id) as HTMLInputElement | null;
  if (elem) 
  {
    const rawInput = elem.value;
    const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(rawInput); // Removes unsafe HTML
    formData[elem.id] = sanitizedInput;
  }
});

// for Testing
console.log(formData);
```

### Alternatives
We used a single-page application *(SPA)*. <br>
The way we handle navigation is by replacing the entire `<body>` content dynamically. <br>The simplest way to do this is with **innerHTML**, which lets us insert new HTML directly.

We looked at alternatives, but they didn‚Äôt quite work for us:
- `element.innerHTML = ...` ‚Üí unsafe unless sanitized with DOMPurify.
- `element.textContent = ...` ‚Üí safe for plain text (but strips HTML).
- `element.insertAdjacentHTML()` ‚Üí same risks as innerHTML.
- `document.createElement() + appendChild()` ‚Üí safe if you construct DOM nodes directly, but less convenient.

‚ùóUse DOMPurify when working with HTML strings and prefer *textContent* for plain text.

<br>


## üå±data-i18n (Language)

We decided we gonna use data-i18n. <br>
data-i18n is just one common convention for handling translations, ***but*** *it‚Äôs not the only option*. <br> Depending on your needs, you can either roll your own approach or use well-established i18n libraries/toolkits that handle translations, pluralization, formatting, and even right-to-left languages. <br> 

### ‚ô£Ô∏èWhat is data-i18n?
data-i18n is not a built-in HTML attribute, but a custom data attribute.
It‚Äôs part of the HTML5 **data-*** **attribute system**, which allows you to store extra information *(custom data)* on HTML elements.

In the case of data-i18n, developers use it to mark elements that should be translated.

### ‚ô£Ô∏èWhy use data-i18n?
Instead of hardcoding text into your HTML like this:
```html
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This is the intro.</p>
```
You write:
```html
<h1 data-i18n="welcome_message"></h1>
<p data-i18n="intro_text"></p>
```
This makes your page language-agnostic. The actual words will be filled in by JavaScript/TypeScript at runtime, depending on the selected language.

### ‚ô£Ô∏èAlternatives to data-i18n

#### üåç 1. Inline text replacement markers <br>
You can insert placeholders directly in your HTML. <br>
A templating engine then replaces those placeholders with the correct translations at runtime.

<br> 

```html
<h1>{{welcome_message}}</h1>
```


`{{welcome_message}}` is a placeholder *(a translation key).*

A templating engine *(like Handlebars, Mustache, Vue, or React)* looks up the key in your translation files. <br>
The engine automatically swaps the placeholder with the correct text for the active language. <br> <br>

#### üåç 2. Popular Toolkits for Internationalization

General JavaScript / Web | Short explanation
--- | ---
i18next | Full-featured i18n library, works in plain JS and all major frameworks. 
FormatJS / React Intl |  Powerful message formatting, best for React apps. 
Polyglot.js |  Lightweight library, good for small projects. 

---

Framework-Specific | Short explanation
--- | ---
React Intl / Next.js i18n | Built for React/Next.js, integrates with components and routing.
Vue I18n | Official Vue plugin for translations.
Angular i18n | Built-in Angular support for template translations.

---

Server-Side *(Backend)* | Short explanation
--- | ---
Django i18n *(Python)* | Built-in translation system using .po files.
Rails i18n *(Ruby)* | Built-in YAML-based translations.
Spring i18n *(Java)* | Uses messages.properties for localization.

---

<br>

### ‚ô£Ô∏èHow it works
The attribute itself does nothing by default‚Äîit‚Äôs just metadata. <br>
What makes it work is JavaScript *(or a translation library)* that reads the data-i18n attributes, looks up the corresponding translations, and replaces the element‚Äôs text.

Here is a small overview how it will work in JavaScript.

#### üåç 1. Create a json file:
You can store translations either as separate files per language or a single combined file.

**Option1:** Separate JSON files *(recommended for larger projects)*
`en.json`
```json
{
    "welcome_message": "Welcome!",
    "intro_text": "This is the intro."
}
```

`de.json`
```json
{
    "welcome_message": "Welkommen!",
    "intro_text": "Dies ist das Intro"
}
```

**Option2:** Single JSON file *(for small projects)*

`language.json`
```json
{
  "en": {
    "welcome_message": "Welcome!",
    "intro_text": "This is the intro."
  },
  "de": {
    "welcome_message": "Welkommen!",
    "intro_text": "Dies ist das Intro"
  }
}
```

The option depends on how much needs to be translated and ofcourse personal preference. <br>
I preferd having every language sepreate. <br> <br>


#### üåç 2. Implement the data-i18n into your HTML
**Before** *(hardcoded text):*
```html
<h1 class="header">Welcome!</h1>
```
**After** *(translation key only):*
```html
<h1 class="header" data-i18n="welcome_message"></h1>
```
**Don't forget to call at the function for the translation** <br> <br>

#### üåç 3. The function 
**Example:**
- Reads the user‚Äôs selected language from localStorage
- Loads the correct JSON file
- Updates all **[data-i18n]** elements with translated text
```typescript
// Import language files
import en from '../languages/en.json';
import de from '../languages/de.json';
import nl from '../languages/nl.json';

export function getLanguage()
{
	let langData: LangData;
	let lang = localStorage.getItem('selectedLang') || 'en';

	// Determine which language data to use
	switch (lang) {
		case 'de':
			langData = de;
			break;
		case 'nl':
			langData = nl;
			break;
		default: // Default to English
            langData = en;
			lang = "en";
			break;
	}

	// Function for setting the language to the correct language
	updateContent(langData);
}

// Function to update content based on selected language
function updateContent(langData: LangData): void {
	document.querySelectorAll('[data-i18n]').forEach((element) => {
		const key = element.getAttribute('data-i18n');
		if (key || langData[key]) 
    		element.textContent = langData[key];
	});

    // Update here other elements if needed (like placeholders)
    // Example: 4. Handle Placeholders
}
```
For more details 
**or** how a switch language buttons functionality works <br>
**please look at:**
`srcs/frontend/src/script/language.ts` <br> <br>

#### üåç 4. Handle Placeholders 
You can also translate placeholders by using a separate attribute like `data-i18n-placeholder` <br>
**Example:**
```html
<p class="login">Username</p>
<input class="input-field" placeholder="Enter your username or email here">
```
<br>

**Which turns into:**
```htm
<p class="login" data-i18n="LoginHeader"></p>
<input class="input-field" data-i18n-placeholder="Login_placeholder">
```
Now you just need to extend the function `updateContent`.<br>
Same logic as with the **data-i18n**, but it will be replaced with **data-i18n-placeholder** <br> <br>

#### üåç 5. Inline Translation
Sometimes you don‚Äôt want the entire sentence translated as one block. <br> <br>
***Common cases:***
- A paragraph where only one word is styled differently *(colored, bold, etc.).*
- A sentence where one word is a link *(‚ÄúClick here to login‚Äù).*
If you just put data-i18n on the whole `<p>`, you‚Äôll lose the formatting or the link.

Wrap them in `<span>` for safer placement. <br>
**Example** <br>

![Picture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/411e3702-928f-4158-a9af-a55b7a2efb7b)

- The word **"Start here"** should be a hyperlink with different styling.
- We split it into two translation keys: ***LoginParagraph*** *and* ***btn_LogIn.***
```html
<p>
    <span data-i18n="LoginParagraph"></span>
    <a class="login" data-i18n="btn_LogIn"></a>
</p>
```
<br>

## üå±Backend Call
-  Connection between frontend and backend
- frontend
The supject requireds you to use a single web application, wich means only one html page is being used. 
We always reloaded the body of the html with the new content we needed.

Things that might be usefull:
call to the backend
took us a while to understand how we call the backend, but is pretty simple.
the string that you get from your html input needs to stringefid. 
export function inputToContent(input: string[]): string {
	const obj: Record<string, string> = {};

	input.forEach(id => {
		const elem = document.getElementById(id) as HTMLInputElement | null;
		if (elem)
		{
			const rawInput = elem.value;
			const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(rawInput); // Removes unsafe HTML
			obj[elem.id] = sanitizedInput;
		}
	});

	const jsonStr = JSON.stringify(obj);
	return jsonStr;
}

const content = inputToContent(["username", "password"]);
			const body = requestBody("POST", content, "application/json");

			try {
				const response = await connectFunc("/user/login", body);
      export async function connectFunc(url: string, request: RequestInit): Promise<Response> {
	
	// console.log("Connect To " + url + " Using:")
	// console.log(request)

	const response = await httpGet("https://localhost:3000" + url, request);
	if (response.status === 402) {
		window.history.pushState({}, '', '/logIn');
		setupLogIn(); // Redirect to logIn
	}
	return response
}
